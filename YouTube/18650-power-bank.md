# Application
This is a power bank diy tutorial I saw on youtube that had implemented the battery managment system.
The project was amazing and very compact.
But there are too many wires hanging around and can easily short the circuitry.

## Future Implementation
I want to design a circuit that includes all the features implemented in the video in my project as well.
It is one of my key motivation.
