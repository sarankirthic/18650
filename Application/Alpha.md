# Application
This is a DIY power bank, that was on youtube, the person had implemented the battery managment system, along with several other features, that looks cool and very intresting to work on.

## Features
* Looks Amazing
* Very Compact
* Battery Managment System
* 200W boost converter
* 12V inverter to 110V
* 12V inverter to 220V
* 12V quick charge
* DC-DC step-down constant current
* The battery packs can be hot swapped

## Advantages
* The components are readily available and are low cost.
* The device is easily portable

## Disadvantages
* There are too many wires hanging around here and there.
* The outer case is 3D printed

## Warning
* The li-ion batteries can catch fire or explode if mishandled.
* Ask Professional's for more guidance.

## Work-Around
I am currently working on the circuit for the powerbank. The design will includes all the features implemented in the video.

### This project is one of my key motivation to learn stuff like this. I was looking for such a device online but they failed. This looks satisfying and lets see how it goes.
