>This repository contains my research on what Li-ion batteries are, how they work and how i created a battery managment system for these cells must have the following components in-order to charge/discharge the li-ion battery saftely:
>* Overcharge
>* Over-discharge
>* Discharge too quickly

## What is 18650
>Its a secret, do not tell anyone. They are lithium ion batteries.
- Lithium ion battery is an advanced battery technology that uses lithium ions as key component of its electrochemical reaction.
- I will discuss about the process in detail in the respective topic guide.
- Right now just remember that the lithium ions move from the negative electrode through an electrolyte to the positive electrode during discharge, and back when charging.

## Advantages of li-ion Battery
* Lithium ion batteries are one of the **highest energy dense** batteries in the world today.
    * They can store up to **100-265 Wh/kg or 250-670 Wh/L.**
* In addition to this they can celiver upto 3.6V.
    * This is **3 times** higher then the Ni-Cd or Ni-Mh battery technologies.
    * They can deliver **large amounts of current** for higher-power applications.
* Lithum Ion batteries require low maintenance
* They do not require scheduled cycling to maintain thier battery life.
* Li-ion batteries have no memory effect.
    * **Memory effect** is a detrimental process where repeated partial discharge/charge cycles can cause a battery to _"remember"_ a lower capacity.
* Li-ion batteries have a low self-discharge rate of 1.5-2 % per month.
* They are easily disposable because they are not made of toxic materials like cadmium.

## Disadvantages of li-ionn Battery

## Development
 
The **18650** cells are Lithium-ion battery.
Lithium-ion battery is a type of rechargeable battery.
 
The **first prototype of the Li-ion battery was developed** by Akira Yoshino. in **1985**, based on the research by John Goodenough, M.Stanley Whittingham, Rachid Yazami and koichi Mizushima during 1970-1980s.
 
The **first commercial batteries** were developed by sony and Asahi Kasei team led by Yoshio Nishi in **1991**.

## Uses
Due to the advantages the li-ion batteries have displace the Ni-Cd batteries in portable electronic devices like laptops and smart phones.

These batteries are also help in millitary and aerospace applications.
