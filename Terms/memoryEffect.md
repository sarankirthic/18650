# Memory Effect
Memory effect, also known as battery-effect, lazy battery effe t or battery memory, is an effect observed in Ni-Cd and Ni-metal hydride rechargeable batteries that causes them to hold less charge.

It is describes the process where the batteries gradually lose thier maximum energy capacity if they are recharged repeatedly after being only partially discharged.
The battery appears to remember the smallet capacity.

## True Memory Effect - The Discovery
The term **memory** came from an aerospace Ni-Cd application in which the cells were repeatedly discharged to 25% of avialable capacity, then recharged to 100% capacity without overcharge.
This long-term, repetitive cycle regime, without overcharge, resulted in a. loss. of capacity beyond discharge point.

The following factors must be met to achieve this condition:
* Battery achieve full overcharge.
* Discharge is not excatly the same each cycle, within the region.( + or - 3% ).
* Discharge is less than 1.0 volt per cell.

True memory effect is difficult to reproduce. 
This effect is specific to sintered-plate Ni-Cd cells

## Other problems
This phenomena may also occur in battery types other than sintered-plate nickel-cadmium cells.
